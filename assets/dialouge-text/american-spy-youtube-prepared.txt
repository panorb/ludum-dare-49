Thank you

very much

for conveying

the President's

questions, General

Taylor. You

are right,

General, a

first strike

against the

Soviet Union

would indeed

be dangerous

for urban

and civilian

areas. The

consequences could

no doubt

be severe.

Although, I

am hesitant

to admit

that I

agree with

Agent Miller

who at

this point

can be

considered a

deserter. Anyway,

I assume

our great

American long-range

missiles have

developed significantly

and can

now take

quite accurate

aim, can't

they? You

are certainly

better qualified

than I

am to

assess our

capabilities. In

any case,

we should

check with

engineers

about how

European satellites

and mainland

China can

be spared

from collateral

damage. There

is no

need to

jump the

gun on

that. As

far as

I've observed,

the USSR

has still

not had

much success

in landing

this kind

of missiles

with a

decent degree

of accuracy.

I've come

to notice

that there

is much

infighting and

disagreement about

the media

between the

Soviet Union

and its

satellite states.

There are

still media

outlets which

refuse to

follow the

politburo's agenda.

The committee

is furious

about their

-- what

they call

- "anti-Soviet"

and "anti-social"

propaganda. Also,

the KGB

is not

exactly known

for treating

opponents with

kid gloves.

Therefore, I've

been wondering

for quite

some time

now how

long they

were gonna

put up

with that,

but now

they seem

to tighten

the reins

once and

for all.

There are

talks about

- and

I quote

- "taking

appropriate measures"

against these

publications -

whatever that

might mean.

They do

sound quite

determined, though.

Maybe there

is an

opportunity to

take advantage

of public

opinion here.

Regarding your

question if

the Soviet

Medium Range

Ballistic Missiles

possibly threaten

Europe, well

..., to

be honest

I would

not worry

too much

about it.

The chances

of that

are, to

my mind,

so remote

that it

is scarcely

worth considering.

If they

really intend

a major

aggression, they

won't do

it out

of the

blue. They

will rather

look for

an ambitious

situation that

would make

for a

good excuse.

The US

must not

provide such

a situation

under any

circumstances. Bear

that in

mind when

making decisions,

General! That's

all I

have to

say for

now. Best

regards to

the President.

God bless

America.
