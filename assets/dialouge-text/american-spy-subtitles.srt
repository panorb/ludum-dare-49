1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,809
Thank you very much

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,046
for conveying the President's

3
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,488
questions, General Taylor.

4
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:05,855
You are right,

5
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:06,355
General,

6
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:08,590
a first strike against

7
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,129
the Soviet Union would indeed

8
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,519
be dangerous for urban

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,740
and civilian areas.

10
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,240
The

11
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,800
consequences could no doubt

12
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,809
be severe.

13
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:16,362
Although,

14
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:17,970
I am hesitant to admit

15
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,055
that I agree with

16
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:19,822
Agent Miller

17
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:20,824
who at this point

18
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:21,411
can be

19
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:21,955
considered a

20
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:22,521
deserter.

21
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,371
Anyway,

22
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,103
I assume our great

23
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:26,966
American long-range missiles

24
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:28,920
have developed significantly

25
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,200
and can now take quite accurate

26
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:30,701
aim,

27
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,399
can't they?

28
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:32,835
You are certainly better

29
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:33,335
qualified

30
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:34,072
than I am to

31
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:35,623
assess our capabilities.

32
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,002
In any case,

33
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:37,753
we should

34
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:38,761
check with engineers

35
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,700
about how European satellites

36
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,208
and mainland China

37
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:43,177
can be spared from

38
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,057
collateral damage.

39
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,820
There is no need

40
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,669
to jump the gun

41
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,170
on that.

42
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:47,093
As far as I've

43
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:47,594
observed,

44
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:48,909
the USSR

45
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:49,409
has still

46
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:50,935
not had much success

47
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:51,906
in landing this kind

48
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,105
of missiles with a

49
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:54,481
decent degree of accuracy.

50
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,240
I've come to notice

51
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,128
that there is much

52
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:58,795
infighting and disagreement

53
00:00:58,795 --> 00:00:59,670
about the media

54
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,170
between the

55
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,963
Soviet Union

56
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:01,464
and its

57
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:02,241
satellite states.

58
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:03,074
There are still

59
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:03,999
media outlets which

60
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,096
refuse to follow

61
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:05,931
politburo's

62
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,447
agenda.

63
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,186
The committee

64
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:07,899
is furious

65
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,822
about their

66
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:09,759
-- what they call -

67
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,058
"anti-soviet" 

68
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:11,742
and

69
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:12,528
"anti-social"

70
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,180
propaganda.

71
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:14,278
Also,

72
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:15,483
the KGB

73
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:16,710
is not exactly known

74
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,131
for treating opponents

75
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:19,220
with kid gloves.

76
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:19,719
Therefore,

77
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,044
I've been wondering for quite

78
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:21,680
some time now how

79
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,573
long they were gonna

80
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:23,445
put up with that,

81
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:24,111
but now

82
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,659
they seem

83
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,436
to tighten the reins

84
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:26,407
once and for all.

85
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:27,718
There are talks about

86
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:28,533
- and I quote -

87
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,278
"taking appropriate measures"

88
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,088
against these

89
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,078
publications

90
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:33,327
- whatever that might mean.

91
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:34,301
They do sound

92
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:35,421
quite determined, though.

93
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:36,363
Maybe there is

94
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:37,326
an opportunity

95
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:38,295
to take advantage

96
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,521
of public opinion here.

97
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,459
Regarding your

98
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,131
question

99
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:41,872
if the Soviet

100
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,769
Medium Range Ballistic Missiles

101
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,084
possibly threaten Europe,

102
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:46,509
well..., to be honest

103
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,068
I would not worry too much about it.

104
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:49,510
The chances of that are,

105
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,246
to my mind,

106
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:51,348
so remote that it is

107
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,376
scarcely worth considering.

108
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:54,540
If they really intend

109
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,623
a major aggression,

110
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,374
they won't do it

111
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,131
out of the blue.

112
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:57,871
They would rather

113
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:58,419
look for an

114
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,386
ambitious situation

115
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:00,196
that will make for a

116
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:01,060
good excuse.

117
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:02,762
The US must not provide

118
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:03,762
such a situation

119
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,129
under any circumstance.

120
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:05,952
Bear that in mind

121
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:06,884
when making decisions,

122
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:07,385
General!

123
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:08,813
That's all I have to say

124
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:09,343
for now.

125
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,570
Best regards to

126
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,187
the President.

127
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,812
God bless America.
