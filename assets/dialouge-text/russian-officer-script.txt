<BEGINNING AND EXPLANATION>
<military voice:>
Second Chief Directorate Sergei, what are you doing? Slacking off??

<military voice:>
If you have nothing to do, then get to the control panel and start the counter-intelligence measure!
I've just received word, that an unidentified American spy in our ranks is trying to pass information to the Americans.
Thankfully, his connection is unstable, so a bit of signal interference should do the job.
Just press the big button in front of you if he says something that better be left a secret of our institution.
But don't overdo it, our power grid is weak, and we can only do as much interference as we have energy in our batteries.
If you run out, you will have to wait for it to slowly recharge again.

<military voice:>
Understood?

<disappointed, military voice:> Alright, I will repeat it... <sigh>

<military voice:> I will now, make a quick call for you to test it out. Censor the part, where I spill critical intelligence about my lunch today.

<TUTORIAL TEXT, PLEASE READ SLOW ENOUGH SO EVERY WORD CAN BE UNDERSTOOD>
<friendly, family voice:> Anya, my beautiful wife. How are you doing today? Did you meet the new neighbors?

Oh my day was good so far, I mean... except for the food... I had a Kulesh-Soup and some ingredient - I think rabbit it was - was not so good for my tummy.

Yes, I would very much like that. Your cooking is the best!

Thank you. God bless mother russia!


<RESULTS FOR TUTORIAL SECTION>
<military voice:> Looks like success! You've censored the part about my lunch today. So no more slacking off! Get started already, I hear the spy is starting to talk at this very moment.

<angry, military voice:> What did you do!! The part about my meal is still in and perfectly understandable... By god, I hope you'll do a better job when it gets serious. Do you want to try it again or get started with the real thing?


<military voice:> Good luck.

<ENDINGS>
<scared voice:> God, you have doomed us all. We will be bombed and it will be your fault. I am going to see my wife, this is it...

<military voice:> You didn't catch it all, but we should be fine... We caught enough of it, so that they might disregard it as untrustworthy. Thanks for your service

<military voice:> Excellent! What they got, was pretty much useless. You did your job well! Thanks for your service.

<military voice:> What... you pretty much censored only the parts that were not relevant at all and left in the bits that gave them information... How? How did you do so bad?? Are you trying to sabotage us?
