1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,440
Second Chief

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,560
Directorate Sergei,

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:02,880
what are

4
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,600
you doing?

5
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,400
Slacking off??

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,600
If you

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,080
have nothing

8
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,480
to do,

9
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,800
then get

10
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,120
to the

11
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,920
control panel

12
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,400
and start

13
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,440
the counter-intelligence

14
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,840
measure!

15
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,720
I've

16
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,440
just received

17
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,000
word, that

18
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,880
an unidentified

19
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,760
American spy

20
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,000
in our

21
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,400
ranks is

22
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,800
trying to

23
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,600
pass information

24
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:17,840
to the

25
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,480
Americans.

26
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,760
Thankfully,

27
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,240
his connection

28
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,040
is unstable,

29
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,280
so a

30
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,600
bit of

31
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,480
signal interference

32
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,800
should do

33
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,600
the job.

34
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,160
Just press

35
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,560
the big

36
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,040
button in

37
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,440
front of

38
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:25,760
you if

39
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,160
he says

40
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,720
something that

41
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,120
better be

42
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,440
left a

43
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,840
secret of

44
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,560
our institution.

45
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,000
But don't

46
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,480
overdo it,

47
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,680
our power

48
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,080
grid is

49
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,400
weak, and

50
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,800
we can

51
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,200
only do

52
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,600
as much

53
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,240
interference as

54
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,560
we have

55
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,960
energy in

56
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,680
our batteries.

57
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,040
If you

58
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,680
run out,

59
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,000
you will

60
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,320
have to

61
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,800
wait for

62
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,040
it to

63
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,160
slowly recharge

64
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,480
again.

65
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,840
Understood?

66
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,960
Alright, I

67
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,600
will repeat

68
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,760
it...

69
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,680
I

70
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,080
will now,

71
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,480
make a

72
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,040
quick call

73
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,360
for you

74
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,760
to test

75
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,480
it out.

76
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,960
Censor the

77
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,440
part, where

78
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,840
I spill

79
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,880
critical intelligence

80
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,200
about my

81
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,920
lunch today.

82
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,880
Anya, my

83
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,840
beautiful wife.

84
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,160
How are

85
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,800
you doing

86
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,440
today?

87
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,680
Did

88
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,080
you meet

89
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,400
the new

90
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,960
neighbors?

91
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh

92
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,800
my day

93
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,360
was good

94
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,920
so far,

95
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,480
I mean...

96
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,040
except for

97
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,600
the food...

98
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,480
I had

99
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,600
a Kulesh-Soup

100
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,080
and some

101
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,800
ingredient -

102
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,280
I think

103
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,840
rabbit it

104
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,320
was -

105
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,800
was not

106
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,200
so good

107
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,600
for my

108
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:11,840
tummy.

109
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:12,960
Yes,

110
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,920
I would

111
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,560
very much

112
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,360
like that.

113
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,000
Your cooking

114
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,240
is the

115
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,720
best!

116
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,240
Thank

117
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,720
you.

118
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,040
God

119
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,760
bless mother

120
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,240
russia!

121
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,240
Looks

122
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,200
like success!

123
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,920
You've censored

124
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,320
the part

125
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,720
about my

126
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,840
lunch today.

127
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,240
So no

128
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,960
more slacking

129
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,360
off!

130
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Get

131
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
started already,

132
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,040
I hear

133
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,400
the spy

134
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,080
is starting

135
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,560
to talk

136
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,880
at this

137
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,520
very moment.

138
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,720
What did

139
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,600
you do!!

140
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,000
The part

141
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,400
about my

142
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,800
meal is

143
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,440
still in

144
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,240
and perfectly

145
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,360
understandable...

146
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,680
By

147
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,160
god, I

148
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,560
hope you'll

149
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,800
do a

150
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,520
better job

151
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:43,840
when it

152
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,880
gets serious.

153
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,120
Do you

154
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,440
want to

155
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,760
try it

156
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,160
again or

157
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,800
get started

158
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,040
with the

159
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,600
real thing?

160
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
Good luck.

161
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,680
God, you

162
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,240
have doomed

163
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,880
us all.

164
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,280
We will

165
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,840
be bombed

166
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,160
and it

167
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,480
will be

168
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
your fault.

169
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,760
I am

170
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,240
going to

171
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,640
see my

172
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,440
wife, this

173
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,840
is it...

174
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,160
You didn't

175
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,560
catch it

176
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:06,880
all, but

177
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,200
we should

178
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,920
be fine...

179
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,320
We catched

180
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,800
enough of

181
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,200
it, so

182
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,520
that they

183
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,240
might disregard

184
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,640
it as

185
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,760
untrustworthy.

186
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,080
Thanks

187
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,640
for your

188
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,800

got, was

191
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,160
pretty much

192
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
useless.

193
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,040
You

194
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,440

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,240

197
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,840
your service.

198
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
What... you

199
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,320
pretty much

200
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,040
censored only

201
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,600
the parts

202
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,840
that were

203
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,720
not relevant

204
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,280
at all

205
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,680
and left

206
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:29,920
in the

207
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,400
bits that

208
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,800
gave them

209
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
information...

210
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,480
How?

211
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,800
How did

212
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,120
you do

213
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
so bad??

214
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,160
Are you

215
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,560
trying to

216
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,840
sabotage us?
