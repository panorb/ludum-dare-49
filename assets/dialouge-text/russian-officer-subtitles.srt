1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,670
Second Chief

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,329
Directorate

3
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:02,329
Sergei,

4
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:02,909
what are

5
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:03,612
you doing?

6
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:04,816
Slacking off??

7
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,370
If you

8
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,039
have nothing

9
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,558
to do,

10
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:09,066
then get

11
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:09,566
to the

12
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:10,474
control panel

13
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:11,326
and start

14
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:12,457
the counter-intelligence

15
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:13,177
measure!

16
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:14,228
I've

17
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:15,000
just received

18
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,045
word, that

19
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,045
an unidentified

20
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:17,923
American spy

21
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:18,545
in our

22
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:19,277
ranks is

23
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:19,823
trying to

24
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:20,823
pass information

25
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:21,323
to the

26
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:22,000
Americans.

27
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,958
Thankfully,

28
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,000
his connection

29
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,159
is unstable,

30
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:25,903
so a

31
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:26,461
bit of

32
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:27,557
signal interference

33
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:28,146
should do

34
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:28,797
the job.

35
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:30,222
Just press

36
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:30,722
the big

37
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:31,222
button in

38
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:31,724
front of

39
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:32,410
you if

40
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:32,910
he says

41
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,639
something that

42
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,167
better be

43
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:34,721
left a

44
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:35,250
secret of

45
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,721
our institution.

46
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:37,889
But don't

47
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:38,662
overdo it,

48
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:39,540
our power

49
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,040
grid is

50
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,540
weak,

51
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:41,263
and we can

52
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:41,897
only do

53
00:00:41,897 --> 00:00:42,556
as much

54
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:43,056
interference

55
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:43,723
as we have

56
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:44,295
energy in

57
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,601
our batteries.

58
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:46,564
If you

59
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:47,136
run out,

60
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:47,832
you will

61
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:48,332
have to

62
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:48,832
wait for it

63
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:50,004
to slowly recharge

64
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:50,611
again.

65
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:53,850
Understood?

66
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:57,056
Alright, 

67
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:57,802
I will repeat

68
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:58,302
it...

69
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:02,141
I will now,

70
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:02,641
make a

71
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,246
quick call

72
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:03,802
for you

73
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:04,302
to test

74
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:04,802
it out.

75
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:05,756
Censor the

76
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:06,302
part, where

77
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:06,865
I spill

78
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:08,083
critical intelligence

79
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:08,682
about my

80
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:09,831
lunch today.

81
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,095
Anya,

82
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,402
my beautiful wife.

83
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:15,287
How are

84
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:15,787
you doing

85
00:01:15,787 --> 00:01:16,287
today?

86
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,271
Did you meet

87
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:17,771
the new

88
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:18,527
neighbors?

89
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:19,671
Oh

90
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:20,184
my day

91
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:20,783
was good

92
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:21,431
so far,

93
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,123
I mean...

94
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:22,763
except for

95
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:23,422
the food...

96
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:24,271
I had a

97
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:24,791
Kulesh-Soup

98
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,291
and some

99
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,038
ingredient

100
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:26,779
- I think

101
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:27,866
rabbit it was -

102
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:28,968
was not

103
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:29,671
so good

104
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,171
for my

105
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:30,671
tummy.

106
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:31,776
Yes, I would

107
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:32,383
very much

108
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:32,956
like that.

109
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:33,838
Your cooking

110
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,048
is the best!

111
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,036
Thank you.

112
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:36,777
God

113
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:37,384
bless mother

114
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:38,166
russia!

115
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:41,722
Looks like success!

116
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:42,485
You've censored

117
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:43,230
the part about

118
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,202
my lunch today.

119
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:44,906
So no more

120
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:45,906
slacking off!

121
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,551
Get started already,

122
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:48,405
I hear

123
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:48,905
the spy

124
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:49,405
is starting

125
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:50,045
to talk

126
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:50,545
at this

127
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:51,545
very moment.

128
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:54,192
What did

129
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:54,884
you do!!

130
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:55,734
The part

131
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:56,404
about my

132
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:56,904
meal is

133
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:57,904
still in

134
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:58,904
and perfectly

135
00:01:58,904 --> 00:01:59,904
understandable...

136
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,341
By god,

137
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:02,286
I hope you'll

138
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:02,876
do a

139
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:03,376
better job

140
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:03,876
when it

141
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:04,588
gets serious.

142
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you want to

143
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,614
try it again

144
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:07,362
or get started

145
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:08,211
with the

146
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,017
real thing?

147
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:11,969
Good luck.

148
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:14,808
God,

149
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:15,520
you have doomed

150
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,267
us all.

151
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,479
We will be bombed

152
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:18,061
and it

153
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:18,561
will be

154
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,244
your fault.

155
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:21,064
I am going to see my wife,

156
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:21,870
 this is it...

157
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:24,649
You didn't

158
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:25,263
catch it

159
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:25,807
all, but

160
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:26,385
we should

161
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:27,385
be fine...

162
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:28,267
We caught

163
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,138
enough of it,

164
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,000
so that they

165
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,868
might disregard it

166
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:32,629
as untrustworthy.

167
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,448
Thanks for your service.

168
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:37,392
 Excellent!

169
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:38,516
What they got

170
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,424
was pretty much

171
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:40,128
useless.

172
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:41,792
You did your job well!

173
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,728
Thanks for your

174
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:43,336
service.

175
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:46,491
What...

176
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:47,774
you pretty much

177
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,000
censored only the parts

178
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,551
that were not relevant at all

179
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:51,305
and left in

180
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:51,805
the bits

181
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,806
that gave them

182
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:53,608
information...

183
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,552
How?

184
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:55,447
How did

185
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:56,081
you do

186
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:56,785
so bad??

187
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,082
Are you trying to sabotage us?
